# Use Bubble Tea for TUI

## Context and Problem Statement

Trebor Sux needs a better TUI than the existing ANSI controls.

## Considered Options

* Use Bubble Tea for TUI
* Use Curses
* Continue with ANSI

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use Bubble Tea for TUI", because the Charm libs provide
a suite of packages for rich console control and display.
