# Trebor Sux

This game plays homage to Wizardry, Dungeons and Dragons and other games 
where created characters crawl a dungeon, encounter monsters, gain skills, 
find treasure and destroy the main wizard.

`PS - TREBOR SUX!`

On the lowest level of Wizardry I's dungeon, this final line appears on a 
sign. "Trebor" refers to one of the game developers, Robert Woodhead (first 
name backwards). I named this game Trebor Sux in honor of my favorite 
childhood game.

## RIP Werdna

The namesake for the evil wizard boss of Wizardry I's dungeon, Werdna, comes 
from game developer Andrew C Greenberg (first name backwards). Andrew passed 
away on August 28, 2024. RIP, Andrew.

`THE WIZARD IS * OUT *!`

## Progress

This started as a Python project, but transitioned to Go. This will never 
likely become a playable game, but it provides a proving ground for 
programming ideas.

At this time, the code only produces an initial splash screen. The game 
will use braille text for graphics, intended for play in a terminal 
window.

## Final Note
